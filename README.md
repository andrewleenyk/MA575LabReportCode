# Analysis of Price and Engine Power in BMW Dataset

This is the R code for plotting the Price (response variable) and Engine Power (covariate) using the `ggplot2` package

I wanted to hold off the interpretation and analaysis for the rest of the team. It might be a great idea to try other covariate relationships and analysis of the scatterplot variance.
